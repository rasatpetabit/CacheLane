# Cachelane Design Suite — Index

This folder is the single source of truth for implementing Cachelane. A new agent reading
only this folder should be able to begin implementation without consulting the raw source documents.

**Document set status:** Complete as of May 2026. Synthesized from 5 source documents (see CLAUDE.md).

---

## Reading Order

**For an agent starting implementation:**
1. [`01-system-overview.md`](01-system-overview.md) — understand the product and its terms (10 min)
2. [`02-architecture.md`](02-architecture.md) — understand what exists and how it connects (20 min)
3. [`04-turns-and-pruning.md`](04-turns-and-pruning.md) — understand the core algorithm (15 min)
4. [`06-systems-design.md`](06-systems-design.md) — understand the implementation plan (30 min)
5. [`03-engineering-specs.md`](03-engineering-specs.md) — check specific requirements as needed

**For a reviewer or architect:**
- Read all files. Start with `01` and `05` for context and rationale.

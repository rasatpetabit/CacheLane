## Detail

### Q001 — Reference-Detection Precision & Recall

**Question:** Does the three-signal deterministic detector (file paths in tool calls + block IDs in
text + 40-char shingle overlap) achieve ≥ 95% precision and ≥ 85% recall against real Claude Code
sessions?

**Why it matters:** If precision is low, too many blocks are incorrectly marked "referenced" and
K-pruning saves fewer tokens. If recall is low, blocks are stubbed when they shouldn't be, causing
unnecessary refetch round-trips.

**Current status:** M4 has a bootstrapped in-repo corpus fixture generated from three real
CacheLane Claude Code sessions. The fixture exercises the CI wiring and regression path, but its
residual labels were prefilled from the deterministic detector and reconciled to detector positives.
It is therefore **not independent quality evidence**.

**Resolution path:**
1. Keep the bootstrapped fixture as a regression corpus for CI wiring.
2. Build an independent annotated corpus before M5 K-pruner work is treated as quality-gated:
   either the original 100-session target, or a smaller statistically-justified sample with
   documented reviewer sign-off.
3. Run the three-signal detector against the independent corpus.
4. Measure precision and recall; CI gate asserts ≥ 95% / ≥ 85%.

**Blocks:** M5 quality gate. The bootstrapped fixture unblocks M4 implementation wiring, but
independent validation remains required before pruner behavior depends on these counters.

**Owner:** Lead engineer  
**Target:** Before M5

### Q002 — Classifier Accuracy

**Question:** Does the fingerprint-based conservative classifier (defaults to `VOLATILE` unless
file paths + last-modified mtimes match a stable signature) correctly classify real-world prompt
blocks?

**Resolution path:** Validate against the same 100-session corpus as Q001 (parallel work).
Initial allowlist (CLAUDE.md, tool schemas, system prompt, pinned files) is a starting point.

**Owner:** Lead engineer  
**Target:** 2 weeks (parallel with Q001)

---

### Q003 — Optimal K Value

**Question:** Is K=3 the right default? What is the optimal K per scenario type?

**Resolution path:** Experiment K ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} across the 5 benchmark scenarios (§2.4.5 of
Phase 2 spec). Measure net effective cost = effective input cost + keepalive overhead. Paired
Wilcoxon signed-rank vs. A1 baseline.

**Current defaults pending experiment:** K=3 (default), K=2 (aggressive), K=5 (conservative).

**Owner:** Lead engineer  
**Target:** 3 weeks after Phase 2 approval

---

### Q004 — Cache-Control Breakpoint Placement for Stable Middle

**Status: Resolved in Systems Design Document.**

**Resolution:** The middle `cache_control` breakpoint is placed **only if** the same turn-window
has been seen byte-identical at least twice. This is the "stable-middle heuristic" implemented in
the Reorderer.

**Implication:** First turn after `/compact` never gets a middle breakpoint; second (identical)
turn gets the breakpoint.

---

### Q005 — Interaction with `/compact`

**Status: Resolved in Systems Design Document + D6 (diagram).**

**Resolution:**
1. Cachelane detects the compacted history by comparing middle-region hashes
2. Removes blocks no longer present from the reference log
3. Creates a new Block for the compacted summary, classifies it as `SEMI`
4. Defers the middle breakpoint until the compacted summary is seen byte-identical twice
5. First turn after `/compact` pays a full middle write; second turn hits the cache

**Implementation hook:** detect in the PreRequest handler by hashing the middle region and
comparing against `CacheStateTracker.middleHash`.

---

### Q006 — Multi-Workspace Operation

**Status: Resolved in Systems Design Document.**

**Resolution:**
- Reference log is keyed by `workspace_id`
- `CacheStateTracker` is also keyed by `workspace_id`
- Prefixes are never shared across workspaces (Anthropic workspace isolation since Feb 5, 2026)
- `workspace_id` comes from Claude Code's workspace identification API (Claude Code ≥ 0.6)

---

### Q007 — Telemetry Default & Activation Mechanism

**Status: Partially resolved.**

**Resolved part:** Telemetry is **OFF by default**. This is binding per Phase 2 spec D9 and
REQ-F-011.

**Unresolved part:** The exact `--opt-in` command shape and the README privacy-policy section
wording. Proposed: `cachelane stats --opt-in` activates it; `cachelane stats --opt-out` disables
it permanently.

**Owner:** Project lead  
**Target:** Before v1 release

---

### Q008 — Tokenizer Model-String Table

**Question:** What are the exact model-string identifiers for Opus 4.6 and Opus 4.7 that the
`@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` SDK requires for the model-string lookup?

**Why it matters:** Opus 4.7 produces up to 35% more tokens for the same input. If the wrong
tokenizer is selected, block-size accounting is wrong, which can break breakpoint placement and
budget decisions.

**Resolution path:** Verify model strings against `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` documentation.
Build a table lookup in the `tokenizer` module; validate in tests for both model versions (AC-14).

**Owner:** Lead engineer  
**Target:** 2 days

---

### Q009 — `tool_use`/`tool_result` Pair Atomicity

**Status: Resolved in Systems Design Document.**

**Resolution:** The Reorderer MUST NOT move `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairs individually. It may
only move whole pairs as a unit. A split invalidates the prefix from that point on.

**Implementation gate:** Reorderer test must assert pair atomicity (AC-16).

---

### Q_A — Keepalive Experiment Funding

**Question:** How will the keepalive experiment API calls be funded?

**Three options:**
- **Option A:** Pro/Max subscription — paced across several days to not exceed 5-hour usage
  windows; $0 additional cash cost; ~2 weeks elapsed
- **Option B:** Analytical-only — use published cache-arithmetic instead of live experiments;
  $0 cost; no empirical benchmarks
- **Option C:** Separate Anthropic API account — ~$80 up-front; fastest

**Current default ship config:** Hybrid policy (B1 adaptive + 1-hour TTL for prefixes > 50k
tokens) is the starting default; experiment results would validate or replace it.

**Blocks:** Empirical keepalive validation in M8 (optional — can ship with analytical default).

**Owner:** Project lead  
**Target:** Before M8

---

### Q010 — Refetch Interaction with Reorderer

**Question:** When the model calls `cachelane:expand` and a block is restored, how does the
Reorderer treat it on the immediately following turn?

**Background:** The restored block enters the suffix on the turn after refetch. On the next turn,
the Classifier re-evaluates its volatility. If it was originally `SEMI`, it may now qualify for
the middle region, but its `unused_turns` counter is 0.

**Resolution:** M5 records `restored_at_turn` on the block row when
`cachelane:expand` returns its trusted refetch request. On the immediately
following turn (`restored_at_turn === current_turn - 1`), PreRequest forces the
restored block's message classification to `VOLATILE`, keeping it suffix-only
for one warming turn. On later turns, normal classifier and reorderer behavior
resumes, including the stable-middle byte-identical heuristic.

**Owner:** —  
**Target:** —

### Q011 — Mid-Turn Error and Turn-End Semantics

**Question:** What happens to `unused_turns` counters if the assistant errors mid-reply (before the
turn ends cleanly)?

**Background:** Turn end is defined as "the assistant stops talking and waits for the user." If the
assistant errors before that, it is unclear whether:
- The failed turn still triggers `unused_turns` increments (conservative: treat as turn-end)
- The failed turn is ignored (counters not ticked)

**Impact:** If errors don't tick counters, blocks can accumulate "free" turns during error storms.
If they do tick, errors accelerate stubbing.

**Owner:** Lead engineer  
**Target:** With orchestrator implementation (M3)

---

### Q012 — Reference-Detection Semantics Beyond the 3-Signal Rule

**Status: Resolved.**

**Resolution:** Only the three-signal deterministic detector is binding:
1. File paths in tool-call arguments
2. Block IDs (injected ULID prefix) in assistant text
3. 40-character shingle exact-match overlap

Any broader interpretation ("paraphrasing counts as a reference") is NOT implemented.
The quality gate (≥ 95% precision, ≥ 85% recall on the corpus) is the acceptance criterion.

## Previously Identified Contradictions (All Resolved)

| # | Contradiction | Resolution |
|---|--------------|------------|
| C1 | Sub-component pipeline order (Diagram 1 showed Classifier→Reorderer→Pruner) | **Classifier→Pruner→Reorderer is canonical.** D1 v2 corrected. Rationale: Pruner changes block sizes/volatility before Reorderer computes breakpoints. |
| C2 | Vocabulary drift (spec "stable/semi/volatile" vs. code "CACHED/WARM/HOT") | **STABLE / SEMI / VOLATILE is the only acceptable vocabulary everywhere** (spec, code, logs, tests). No alternative naming. Clarified in Phase 2 spec v2 §6.4. |
| C3 | Phase 2 spec section numbering (§6 guardrails printed as §7.x internally) | **Fixed in Phase 2 spec v2.** All §7.x headings corrected to §6.x. |
| C4 | Cache state tracker had no drawn interactions in D1 | **Fixed in D1 v2.** Interaction arrows added: reads counters, writes prefix hash, reads expiry, updates expiry. |
| C5 | Keepalive sequence not diagrammed | **Fixed: D5 added in Diagrams v2.** 10-second check loop, idle + expiry conditions shown. |
| C6 | `/compact` handling not diagrammed | **Fixed: D6 added in Diagrams v2.** Full sequence: hash detection → block removal → SEMI classification → deferred breakpoint. |
| C7 | Refetch flow not diagrammed | **Fixed: D7 added in Diagrams v2.** Full sequence: `cachelane:expand` → SQLite lookup → original tool call → counter reset. |
| C8 | 100-session corpus dependency implicit | **Partially fixed:** M4 now has a bootstrapped in-repo regression corpus, but independent precision/recall validation remains tracked by Q001 before M5. |
